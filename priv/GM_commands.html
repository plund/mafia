              PLAYER ... DIED<br>
              PLAYER ... DEAD<br>
              PLAYER ... BEEN LYNCHED<br>

          <td valign="top"><font size="-0">
              The bot considers a PLAYER as DEAD when it sees a
              <b>correctly spelled</b> player name on one line in a GM
              message and one of "DIED", "DEAD" or "BEEN LYNCHED" later
              on the same line. The 3 "..." means that there may be other
              words in this position.
              <p>
                Continue the line with "He/she was" and the bot will present
                this GM death comment on the status pages.
                If "He/she was" is missing the full line will be presented as
                the GM death comment.
              <p>
                <b>Method</b><br>
                1. Bot search for any of "DIED", "DEAD" or "BEEN LYNCHED" in GM
                messages.
                <br>
                2. Bot tries to find a <b>correctly spelled</b> player name
                before on the same line and sentence (case does not matter).
                <br>
                3. Bot tries to find "He/She was" after the "DIED" word on the
                same line. If found the remaining of the line will be used as
                the GM death comment. If not found the whole line will be used.

              The bot ends the current phase and start next phase.
              Later deadlines for upcoming phases are <b>not moved</b> in time
              due to this GM command.
              <p>
                <b>Method</b><br>
                1. Bot search for "ENDED EARLY"
                <br>
                2. Bot verfies that "DAY" or "NIGHT" can be found earlier on the
                same line and that it matches the current phase type.
                (if it finds "day" when it is night the phase will not end)
              <p>
                <b>Important:</b> Please note the relation to the next command
                for deadline movements. There will be different future
                deadlines scheduled dependent on the order the end phase and
                deadline movement commands are issued.<br>
                This end phase command should normally be done before moving the
                deadline.

              The bot moves the deadline time of the current phase earlier or
              later with the number of hours given. When moving the current
              phase earlier, the bot will not allow the current phase deadline
              to be moved into the past.
              <p>
                <b>Note 1:</b> All deadlines occuring <b>after</b> the
                current deadline that we moved, are also them
                moved the same number of hours earlier
                or later as the current deadline was moved.
              <p>
                <b>Note 2:</b> The schedule for the next 3 deadlines are
                visible on the current game status page if the game has
                not ended.
              <p>
                <b>Method</b><br>
                1. The bot looks for one line in a GM message containing
                the words "DEADLINE", "MOVED" and either "LATER" or "EARLIER"
                in the order listed.<br>
                2. The Bot expects to find the time after "MOVED" and before
                "LATER" or "EARLIER".

              If the bot in a GM message can find one line containing two
              exact user names *NEW* and *OLD* with only " HAS REPLACED "
              or " IS REPLACING " in between, then the bot
              will replace the old player *OLD* in the game with player *NEW*.
              This is needed for the bot to start
              register votes from the new player *NEW* and to make it
              possible for other players to vote for *NEW*.

              The game END messages put the game into the end of game phase.
              The bot change its game status presentation to present the
              end of game. The bot stops looking for player votes and
              all other GM commands except the UNEND command.
              <p>
                The various game UNEND commands remove the game end AND
                restores a new deadline schedule from the last past deadline.

              <b>Notes:</b>
            <p>
              - Upper or lower case does not matter. The bots converts all text
              to upper case before it starts looking for GM commands.
            <p>
              - Before each game the bot is told which player ids the GMs have
              and which thread that is the game thread. The bot will look for
              GM commands in everything written by any GM in the game thread.
            <p>
              - The bot is given a time schedule (first EoD1 time and the
              length of the days and nights).
            <p>
              - The bot will follow the time schedule exactly how it is setup
              from the start (also taking DST changes into consideration)
              as long as the GMs do not <b>by command</b> end a phase early
              or move the deadline later or earlier.
            <p>
              - The bot is also told about who is playing the game and if
              there are any DST changes coming up for the game.
              The game normally follows the DST changes of he main GM's timezone.
