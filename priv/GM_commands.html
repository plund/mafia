          </td>
          <td valign="top">
            The bot considers a PLAYER as DEAD when it sees a
            <b>correctly spelled</b> player name on one line in a GM
            message and one of "DIED", "DEAD" or "BEEN LYNCHED" later
            on the same line. The 3 "..." means that there may be other
            words in this position.
            <p>
              <b>Method</b><br>
              1. Bot search for any of "DIED", "DEAD" or "BEEN LYNCHED" in GM
              messages.<br>
              2. Bot tries to find a <b>correctly spelled</b> player name
              before on the same line and sentence (case does not matter).

          </td>
          <td valign="top">
            The bot ends the current phase by moving the deadline of the
            current phase to the time of the GM message containing this text.
            The deadline times for later phases are <b>not changed</b>
            <p>
              <b>Method</b><br>
              1. Bot search for "HAS ENDED" and for "HAS BEGUN" in GM messages.
              <br>
              2. Bot verfies that "DAY" or "NIGHT" can be found earlier on the
              line. (but it ignores if this text does not match the current
              phase type)

          </td>
          <td valign="top">
            The bot moves the deadline time of the current phase earlier or
            later with the number of hours given.
            <p>
              <b>Method</b><br>
              1. Bot search for "DEADLINE" in GM messages.<br>
              2. Bot search for "LATER" or "EARLIER" after on same line<br>
              3. Before on the same line the bot will look for the number of
              hours

              <p>
              - Upper or lower case does not matter. The bots converts all text
              to upper case before it starts looking for GM commands.
              <p>
              - Before each game the bot is told which player ids the GMs have
              and which thread that is the game thread. The bot will look for
              GM commands in everything written by any GM in the game thread.
