              Upper or lower case does not matter. The bots converts all text
              to upper case before it starts looking for player votes.

              The player that at the end of day have received more votes than
              any other player and more votes than the No-Lynch alternative,
              is lynched (dies) by the end of the day.
              The number of Unvote votes does not count.
