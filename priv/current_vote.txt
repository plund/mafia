Hello!

Due to a minor reorg the current_vote.txt has moved to a new place.
Each game has its own dir m25/ or m26/ AND I decided to change the
file name to "current_game_status.txt".

New links are:

  http://mafia.peterlund.se/m25/current_game_status.txt
     or
  http://mafia.peterlund.se/m26/current_game_status.txt


BUT why don't you try out the html based version of Mafia Tracker?

You find that one easily on:     http://mafia.peterlund.se/


Best regards,
Peter Lund
