                Quotes must be used to search for something containing a space.
                Normally spaces divide up words so then you may need to use
                quotes ("")
                For example to search for the full string "Hellenic Riot",
                quotes are needed.
              <p>
                Minimum one search condition must be specified.
                Either a one or more user names or
                one or more words that must be found in the message or
                one single day number.
              <p>
                Spaces (and) between words in the word condition, means that
                all words must be found in the message.
                If "|" (or) is used between the words only one of the words
                must be found in the message.
              <p>
                Spaces in the User name fields is "or". Do not use "|" here.
              <p>
                Inserting anything starting with "end" in the day number field
                will display messages posted after the game has ended. It is
                also possible to search day number to end, e.g. "5-end".
              <p>
                Upper or lower case does not matter in user name and word
                searches. Case do not matter for the word "end" either.
