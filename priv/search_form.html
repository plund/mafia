              <b>Notes:</b>
              <p>
                Upper or lower case does not matter in any type of search
                condition. Case do not matter for the word "end" either.
              <p>
                Quotes must be used to search for something containing a space.
                Normally spaces divide up words so then you may need to use
                quotes ("")
                For example to search for the full string "Hellenic Riot",
                quotes are needed.
              <p>
                Minimum one search condition must be specified.
                Either a one or more user names or
                one or more words that must be found in the message or
                one single day number.
              <p>
                In the User condition a space between two user is "or".
                Messages for both users are listed.
              <p>
                In word conditions, a space between two words is "and", meaning
                that both words need to exist in the message for it to match.
                The "|" character between two words is or, meaning that only
                one of the two words must be found in the message.
                Words normally need to have word bondaries, so that a search
                for "nd" does not match the word "and". Add the "*" char at the
                beginning or end to remove the word boundary requirement.
                Searching for "*nd*" matches "and" but also "mandelbrot".
                Searching for "Jamie*|pete*" will result in all message where
                a word starts with either "Jamie" or "pete"
              <p>
                Words searched for will be
                <b><font size=\"+1\">highlightened</font></b> in the resulting
                output.
              <p>
                Inserting anything starting with "end" in the day number field
                will display messages posted after the game has ended. It is
                also possible to search day number to end, e.g. "5-end".
