              <b>Notes:</b>
              <p>
                The <b>MAX output</b> of any search is <b>400k byte</b>!
                You need to modify your search conditions if you reach this limit.
              <p>
                Upper or lower case does not matter in any type of search
                condition.
              <p>
                Quotes must be used to search for something containing a space.
                Normally spaces divide up words so then you may need to use
                quotes ("")
                For example to search for the full string "Hellenic Riot",
                quotes are needed.
              <p>
                Minimum one search condition must be specified.
                Either a one or more user names or
                one or more words that must be found in the message or
                one single day number.
              <p>
                In the <b>User</b> conditions, a space between two user names
                means "or". User search for "brain* peter*" will show messages
                from both brainbomb and peterlund. Searching for aliases does
                NOT work.
              <p>
                In the <b>Word</b> conditions, a space between two words means
                "and". Both words need to exist in the message for it to match.
                The "|" character between two words means "or". Only
                one of the two words must be found in the message to match.
              <p>
                <b>Word boundary</b> requirements do apply for both the
                <b>User</b> and <b>Word</b> conditions.
                Use "*" to remove boundary
                requirement at end or beginning eg "brain*", "peter*"
                <br>
                Searching for "nd" matches the word "nd" but not the word "and".
                <br>
                Add the "*" character at the beginning or end to remove the
                word boundary requirement in those positions.
                Searching for "*nd*" matches "nd" but also "and" and "mandelbrot".
                <br>
                Doing a word search for "Jamie*|pete*" will result in all
                messages where any word starts with either "Jamie" or "pete"
              <p>
                Words searched for will be
                <b><font size=\"+1\">highlightened</font></b> where they are
                found  in the resulting output.
              <p>
                In the <b>Page/Phase</b> condition a single number is a
                page number. A page can also be given using "p33" or "page 33"
                Here you can also enter "d3" or "D3" or "day 3" which all will
                output messages for day 3. Same for "n1", "N 1" and "night 1".
              <p>
                You can give a sequence like "D3-N3", "page 1 - page 13" or
                even mixed "p30-d1". You may also start or end with dash.
                "-6" will result in pages 1-6, while "N4 -" returns messages
                for night 4 and everying coming after even End of Game messages.
                Only "end" will give only EoG messages.
              <p>
                <b>Word</b> searches including UNICODE letters are at the moment
                not supported.
                If you want to search for "doppelg&auml;nger" you need to use
                the "*" in your search. Word searching for "doppelg* *nger"
                returns all variations.
